10 new Gutenberg blocks with section templates and page templates. With C9 Blocks + Themes, the digital agency is built right into the code.

== Description ==

[COVERT NINE](https://www.covertnine.com)'s C9 Blocks plugin provides 10 new Gutenberg blocks, plus an interface for creating pages from section templates, or fully-built page templates. Block landing page templates are usable for any purpose but designed to give organizations a head start on creating landing pages with specific purposes for their audience.

The landing page templates are organized in a modal by the "content journey" step (Awareness, Consideration, Conversion) and can be accessed from the feather logo icon in the upper right corner after installing the WordPress plugin.

Plugin can be installed from the WordPress admin via file upload, or by cloning the Github repo. We recommend using a [C9 supported theme](https://www.covertnine.com/c9-blocks-plugin) with the C9 Blocks plugin, but it also works with the [Twenty Twenty One](https://2021.covertnine.com), Twenty Twenty and Twenty Nineteen WordPress themes. We recommend using the [C9 Starter](https://wordpress.org/themes/c9-starter), [C9 Work](https://wordpress.org/themes/c9-work) theme, or [C9 Togo](https://wordpress.org/themes/c9-togo) theme to see C9 Blocks in action, or signup for the [C9 early access list](https://www.covertnine.com/forms/c9-beta) to get all of our premium themes and plugins for free! We currently have four blocks-based themes and four child themes available for early access list subscribers and an exclusive [C9 Blocks Animation Plugin](https://c9.covertnine.com/c9-animation-plugin/) to animate any core WordPress blocks or C9 Blocks.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can C9 Blocks be used with any theme? =


The current blocks plugin supports the WordPress Twenty Nineteen, WordPress Twenty Twenty, WordPress Twenty Twenty One, C9 Starter, C9 Music, C9 Work, and the C9 Togo WordPress themes.

We're working to make the plugin work with other themes as well. If you have a page template that supports full-width layouts, then the C9 Blocks plugin should work with most Bootstrap and some non-Bootstrap themes.

= Do I need the new block editor to use C9 Blocks? =

Yes, you will need to have WordPress 5.7 or later installed to take advantage of C9 Blocks, and if you have the latest versin of the Gutenberg plugin installed, you can use the BlockPreview support we have built into our saved templates modal, but there may be some conflicts that exist as we haven't fully tested the latest Gutenberg plugin editor with our theme/plugin.
