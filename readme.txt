== Description ==

[COVERT NINE](https://www.covertnine.com)'s C9 Blocks plugin provides 10 new Gutenberg blocks, plus an interface for creating pages from section templates, or fully-built page templates. Block landing page templates are usable for any purpose but designed to give organizations a head start on creating landing pages.

The landing page templates are organized in a modal by the "content journey" step (Awareness, Consideration, Conversion) and can be accessed from the feather logo icon in the upper  right corner after installing the WordPress plugin.

Plugin can be installed from the WordPress admin via file upload, or by cloning the Github repo. We recommend using a [C9 WordPress Theme](https://www.covertnien.com/forms/c9-beta) with the C9 Blocks plugin, but it also works with the Twenty Twenty and Twenty Nineteen WordPress themes.

For an overview of each of the blocks, and more up to date documentation, head over to our [documentation  site](https://c9.covertnine.com).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/c9-blocks` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Appearance->C9 Blocks screen to see a quick overview for using the plugin, and you can access your Reusable Block Layouts you save at Appearance -> C9 Reusable Blocks.
4. The C9 Blocks plugin should redirect you to this quick start guide after activation. Blocks can be accessed from the + icon or the feather logo icon in the upper right hand corner form any Gutenberg editing screen


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can C9 Blocks be used with any theme? =

The current blocks plugin supports the WordPress Twenty Nineteen, upcoming WordPress Twenty Twenty Beta Theme, as well as the C9 Starter Theme. We're working to make the plugin work with other themes too. If you have a page template that supports full-width layouts, then the C9 Blocks plugin should work with most Bootstrap and some non-Bootstrap themes.

= Do I need the new block editor to use C9 Blocks? =

Yes, you will need to have WordPress 5.0 or later installed to take advantage of C9 Blocks, and if you have the latest versin of the Gutenberg plugin installed, you can use the BlockPreview support we have built into our saved templates modal, but there may be some conflicts that exist as we haven't fully tested the latest Gutenberg plugin editor with our theme/plugin.

It's based on [Understrap](https://understrap.com/), but with an innovative approach to using Gutenberg's editing system and a more minimal minimal theme skin to start with.

If you're working on behalf of a client or customer and want to build your own style guide and/or themes on top of the [C9 Starter Theme](https://c9.covertnine.com), included is a client boilerplate folder and full child theme support.
